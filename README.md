## Description

A maze game that has 3 levels.

---

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Loads JSON levels (preload)
- Builds Level objects
- Creates/positions the Player
- Handles input + level switching

It is intentionally light on "details" because those are moved into:

- Level.js (grid + drawing + tile meaning)
- Player.js (position + movement rules)

---

## Assets

N/A

---

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane and David Han but they used GenAI to write the comments. It was then altered by Cohen Peters in which no AI was used.
